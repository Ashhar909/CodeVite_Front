        Our policy lasts 5 days. If 5 days have gone by since your enrollment
        into any of our programme, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or
        change of a programme.

        No refunds would be entertained after your acceptance letter has been
        generated. Application fees would be refunded only under special
        circumstances .
      </p>
      <p>
        No partial refunds/certification offered if you choose to leave any of
        our programme midway.
