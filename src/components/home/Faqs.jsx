            Q.) How do I know that I have been accepted or rejected from one of
            the Codevita Live’s workshops?
          </b>
        </h6>
        <p>
          Ans.) It doesn’t takes us more than a week to review your application
          and delight you with that acceptance you have been waiting for. Beyond
          that, it might turn out that we couldn’t accept you in that cohort .
          There is no reason to be demotivated here ,as maybe we thought that
          you are more suitable to be a future Puskas award winner than a STEM
          leader, or maybe you were way too overpowered and we thought we won’t
          be able to contribute in your growth. Or maybe just the cohorts were
          full . In any of the case, if you want to feel how the Codevita Edge
          feels like you can always mail us at our
          <a href="mailto:admin@codevitalive.tech">official ID</a> to see what
          is in store for you!

          <b>Q) Does Codevita Live provide live online classes?</b>
        </h6>
        <p>
          Ans.) We don’t provide live online classes and our modus operandi is
          completely different. We follow a module based system where you have
          to give an checkpoint exam related to the contents of the previous
          week’s contents to proceed to unlock the further contents of the
          course. This ensures that our students have a proper understanding of
          the course contents being covered.

          <b>Q.) Does Codevita Live provide placement assistance?</b>
        </h6>
        <p>
          Ans.) Assistance? Yes. Guarantee? No. Codevita Live doesn’t forge
          partnerships with any employers or invite any recruiter to hire it’s
          students but provides several tools and services to assist its
          students in achieving their goals. As we train students with a wide
          variety of backgrounds ranging from RMIT Australia to University Of
          Alberta in Canada, providing placement guarantee wouldn’t quite be
          possible for us.
